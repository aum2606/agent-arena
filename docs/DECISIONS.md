# Decisions

Append-only. Never edit an old entry; add a new one that supersedes it.

## D-001 · 2026-10-30 · Tooling and project setup

**Decision:** `uv` project with `uv_build` backend and `src/arena` layout, Python pinned to 3.12
(`requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"`). Dev tools: pytest, ruff (E, F, I, UP, B, SIM), mypy
strict on `src/`, vulture, pre-commit. Pre-commit uses `local` hooks that call `uv run`, so
tool versions come from the lockfile rather than a second pinned set. Runtime deps: openai,
sympy, python-dotenv.

**Why:** The machine has Python 3.14; the project standard is 3.12, so it is pinned. Local
hooks avoid version drift between pre-commit and `uv.lock`. A real build backend is needed for
the `arena` console script.

**Alternatives considered:** hatchling (extra tool for no gain), `pre-commit` remote repos
(duplicate version pins), no build backend with `python -m arena` (worse CLI ergonomics).

## D-002 · 2026-10-30 · Running model-written code is not a secure sandbox

**Decision:** Attacker snippets run in a subprocess with a hard timeout, a fresh temp dir and
a minimal environment. This is NOT a secure sandbox: the snippet can still read the user's
files and use the network. Real isolation (containers) is Phase 1. Defender answers are parsed
with SymPy, whose parser evaluates text; that risk is accepted in Phase 0 for the same reason.

**Why:** Phase 0 only needs to prove the rules are balanced; Docker is out of scope.

**Alternatives considered:** Docker or a restricted interpreter now (out of Phase 0 scope).

## D-003 · 2026-10-30 · Rule clarifications for Phase 0

**Decision:**
- Malformed attacker output (unparseable, or missing problem, answer or snippet) is a backfire.
- Defender exceeding the time or token budget logs `timeout`, scores 0 and takes a hit.
- If a provider call still fails after the retry limit, the match is aborted and left to resume;
  it is never scored.
- A turn is won by the attacker when a hit lands; it is won by the defender on a block or a
  backfire. The 70% gate is measured over these per-turn outcomes.
- Equal HP after round 6 is a draw and counts for neither side.
- The attacker's stated answer vs its snippet output, and the defender's answer vs the stated
  answer, are both compared with SymPy equality.

**Why:** The brief left these open; each is the simplest reading consistent with the rules.

**Alternatives considered:** scoring provider failures as a loss (would skew the balance
stats with infrastructure noise).

## D-004 · 2026-10-30 · Initial tunable numbers

**Decision:** Defender time limit 60 s, defender token cap 1024, snippet timeout 5 s, delay
between calls 2 s, max retries 5. They live in a `[settings]` table in
`config/fighters.toml` (added in the config task), not in code.

**Why:** The brief required these budgets but gave no values; free tiers are slow and rate
limited, so the defaults are conservative. Expect to tune them after the first live runs.

**Alternatives considered:** a separate `config/game.toml` (extra file, a layout change).

## D-005 · 2026-10-30 · Vulture also scans tests while modules are unwired

**Decision:** Until the orchestrator (task 6) wires the modules together, the dead-code check
is `uv run vulture src tests`. From task 6 on it is `uv run vulture src` as in CLAUDE.md, and
it must pass clean at the gate.

**Why:** The modules are built bottom-up, so pure functions are only called by their tests
until the orchestrator exists. `vulture src` alone flags all of them; a whitelist or ignore
would hide real dead code later.

**Alternatives considered:** a vulture whitelist file (a suppression that could outlive its
reason), building the orchestrator first (breaks tests-first, bottom-up tasks).

## D-006 · 2026-10-30 · A round is one turn; matches last 6 turns

**Decision:** "Round" and "turn" mean the same thing. A match is at most 6 turns, so each
fighter attacks 3 times. `max_turns = 6` is passed to `match_result` by the orchestrator.

**Why:** The spec uses the two words interchangeably, and the owner chose this reading.

**Consequence:** With base damage 20 and 100 HP, a KO needs 5 hits on one fighter out of 6
turns, so most matches will end by decision. The KO-vs-decision stat will be uninformative
unless damage is raised. Revisit with a superseding entry if the first sims show this matters.

**Alternatives considered:** 6 rounds of 2 turns each (12 turns, realistic KOs).

## D-007 · 2026-10-30 · mypy ignores missing stubs for sympy only

**Decision:** `ignore_missing_imports` is set for `sympy` and `sympy.*` in the mypy config.

**Why:** sympy has no stubs or `py.typed` marker, so strict mypy rejects the import. Calls into
sympy are wrapped in `verifier.py`, which exposes typed functions to the rest of the code.

**Alternatives considered:** `types-sympy` (does not exist), `# type: ignore` on each import
(same effect, scattered), a hand-written stub (speculative for two functions).
